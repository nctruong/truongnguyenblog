There are no parties or gifts or representative foods. You don’t spend time preparing for the day; instead, it’s a day of action and accomplishment. Yet the holiday, even though there is certainly an expected degree of discomfort, creates a surprisingly euphoric feeling that grows with every completed task.

It took literally five minutes, and it was gone from my to-do list.I organized my estimated tax slips and envelopes so that they would be ready to mail each quarter. It took literally five minutes, and it was gone from my to-do list.&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I “fired” a client that didn’t pay enough and whom my business had outgrown.
